            Welcome to my portfolio website! My name's Lauren, though some call me Loz. I'm from Victoria, Australia and now reside in South East Queensland with my partner and two dogs, a border collie called Koda and a groodle called Sadie.
          </p>
          <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy:
            <ul>
              <li> üì∫ Binging Netflix (I love lots of genres, but horror, science fiction and fantasy are amongst my favourites)</li>
              <li> üê∂ Spending time with my family, friends and dogs</li>
              <li> üéÆ Unwinding with some competitve games, such as League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics. When I'm brave enough, I'll dip my toes into some Dead by Daylight and Phasmophobia üëª</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Career</h2>
          <article class="about-text">
          <p>
            My early career was a customer-facing one at one of my favourite stores (before they closed down) - Borders! For those of you that didn't get the pleasure, Borders was predominantly a bookstore that also sold music and movies. Some stores also had a cafe within (books and coffee really are a match made in heaven). This job really surprised me, because it taught me that although I'm an introvert, I enjoyed being with people surrounded by common interests. I also really loved helping people.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to study an Advanced Diploma of Legal Practice and then started my career in law, in varying capacities such as personal assistant, paralegal and conveyancer. However, I did feel after a few years that something was missing. Being a paralegal did satisfy the part of my mind that enjoyed logic, order and procedural structure, but there was something missing. I desired a career that could satisfy my creative side (although, it's somewhat dormant now) as well as be flexible and progressive in terms of work-life balance.
          </p>
          <p>My circumstances changed in 2021. The ceiling in my rental collapsed and my partner, dogs and I were forced to leave. With nowhere to go and our bond in dispute, we drove up to Queensland from Victoria in the middle of a pandemic with the essentials to stay with family, essentially 'starting again'. I used that as my chance to study what I had always been curious about and dabbled in - Web Development.

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <article class="about-text">
          <p>
            My earliest memory of coding was when I was in high school. I'd use dial-up internet when I got home from school, and enjoyed loging in to this website called 'Neopets'. This website allowed you to have your own virtual pets, play games, and be in social 'guilds' with other Neopets users. It was there that I started learning HTML to spruce up my profile, and write fanfiction-like stories on the guild's webpage.
          </p>
          <p>Later on, I would also have a Myspace page, and more HTML ensued.</p>
          <p>However, my life and early career took a different path. I did not touch coding again until November of 2021, when I completed the SheCodes Basics course. I told myself that if I enjoyed it, I would seriously consider this career change to web development. And I did. </p>
          <p>I enrolled in the Coder Academy Web Development bootcamp beginning early 2022, where for 10 months I would learn the building blocks of front and back end web development. I'm still in the process of completing it, but I'm really enjoying the journey so far.</p>
          <p>Below are some of the skills I will be learning at Coder Academy.</p>
